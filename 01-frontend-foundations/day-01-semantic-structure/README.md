# 🧱 Day 1 — Professional Semantic HTML Structure

This project is part of my structured roadmap to become a professional Frontend Developer.
The focus of this day was to build a clean, semantic, and accessible HTML foundation using modern best practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To create a professionally structured HTML layout applying:

* Proper use of `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`
* Correct heading hierarchy (`h1–h3`)
* Basic accessibility practices `aria-labelledby`
* Semantic elements like `<time>`
* Clear separation between semantics and layout (`div` only when necessary)

This project intentionally focuses on **structure over styling**.
