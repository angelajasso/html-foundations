# 🚀 Engineering Foundations — Full Stack & Web3 Path

This repository documents my structured progression toward becoming a Full Stack Engineer with Web3 specialization.

The focus is on building strong engineering fundamentals across:

* Frontend architecture
* Backend principles
* Database modeling
* Blockchain fundamentals
* Smart contract concepts
* Scalable system thinking
  
---

## 🎯 Philosophy

Rather than isolated tutorials, this repository follows a modular and documented approach.

Each section represents:

* Core concepts
* Clean implementations
* Architectural reasoning
* Iterative refinement

The objective is long-term engineering maturity.
